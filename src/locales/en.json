      "text": "We went on a family holiday and took our two little dogs and we loved it! The area around the house (native forest) is magnificent, the space is super comfortable and cosy! We had everything we needed. We even had the chance to sip our hot coffee at one of the little tables by the lake. We'll definitely be back!",
