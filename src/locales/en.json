      "text": "We went on a family holiday and took our two little dogs and we loved it! The area around the house (native forest) is magnificent, the space is super comfortable and cosy! We had everything we needed. We even had the chance to sip our hot coffee at one of the little tables by the lake. We'll definitely be back!",

      "text": "Maybe not for everyone but we experienced the house and surroundings as a little paradise. The house has character and the whole lot around it is beautiful. It is quiet and has lots of space. The pool is a real pool, and not an enlarged sort of bath tub. A beautiful view is included.",
